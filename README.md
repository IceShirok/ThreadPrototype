ThreadPrototype
===============
This was a prototype I made for my company. I was not really familiar with multi-threading, so I spent a few days researching threads and making my sample prototype. I also learned a lot about file I/O and how to handle them through threads, as well as reinforcing my knowledge of data structures.
